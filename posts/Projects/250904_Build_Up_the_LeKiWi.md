# Build Up the [LeKiWi](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/lekiwi)

[‚Üê Back to Previous Page](../../../pages/project_LeRobot.html)

## Overview
The LeKiWi is a mobile manipulator robot platform developed by [LeRobot](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/lekiwi). It consists of a mobile base and a 6-DoF robotic arm, the [SO101](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/en/so101).

### Works done so far
- The LeRobot follower arm has been built and tested. [details](./250817_Set_Up_the_Follower_Arm.md)
- The LeRobot leader-follower control system has been implemented and tested. [details](./250824_Wired_Leader_Follower_Control.md)

### Objectives
- Build up the LeKiWi robot platform. 
    - It should be able to move.
    - The video stream from both cameras mounted on the base and the endeffector should be accessible.
